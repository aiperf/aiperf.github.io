    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
    	AIPerf intends to foster the usage of AI  (such as probabilistic methods, machine learning, and deep learning) to control, model, and predict the performance of computer systems.
    	The timeliness and relevance of this topic reflect current and future trends toward exploiting AI-based approaches to deal with complex, large, and interconnected systems.
    	However, AI-based approaches are rarely adopted to control the performance of ICT systems. Moreover, they are often employed in their generic form (i.e., black-box modeling) and are not specialized for the intended use. This causes the creation of models that take a lot of time and data to be created and are not easily intelligible to a domain expert.
	Researchers and practitioners have recently started to turn their efforts to this topic, but methods and tools (as well as data sets) that enable the adoption of AI-based solutions in performance engineering are still missing.
	AIPerf aims to bring together AI practitioners and performance engineers and promote the dissemination of research works that use or study AI techniques for quantitative analysis of modern ICT systems.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
    <p>
    	Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are widely adopted techniques to investigate several mainstream domains (e.g., computer vision, natural language processing, and even reliability analysis). However, their usage for performance modeling and evaluation is still limited, and their benefit to the performance engineering field remains unclear. AIPerf 2023 proposes a meeting venue to promote the dissemination of research works that use or study AI techniques for quantitative analysis of modern ICT systems and to engage academics and practitioners of this field. The workshop focuses on presenting experiences and results of applying AI/ML-based techniques to performance-related problems, as well as sharing performance datasets and benchmarks with the community to facilitate the development of new and more accurate learning procedures.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    	We solicit two tracks of submission:
    	<ul>
    		<li><b>Regular research papers (max 8 pages).</b> Novel contributions that are fully validated and well positioned in the state-of-the-art.</li>
    		<li><b>Empirical, experience, reproduction or case study papers (max 6 pages).</b> Work-in-progress; Vision papers; New ideas that still need to be validated; Industrial case studies; Experiences (positive or negative) of using AI for performance engineering.</li>
    	</ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>

    <h2>Instructions for Authors from ACM</h2>
    <p>
    	By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects">Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects</a>. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    	Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an <a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCID ID</a>, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors.  The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022.  We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
