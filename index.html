    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
    	AIPerf intends to foster the usage and advance the explainability of AI  (such as probabilistic methods, machine learning, and deep learning) to control, model, and predict the performance of computer systems.
    	The timeliness and relevance of this topic reflect current and future trends toward exploiting AI-based approaches to deal with complex, large, and interconnected systems.
    	AI tools are often employed in their generic form (i.e., black-box modeling) and are not specialized for the intended use. This causes the creation of models that take a lot of time and data to be created and are not easily intelligible to a domain expert.
    	Facing such challenges, researchers and practitioners have recently started to focus on methods such as explainable/white-box AI-based solutions in performance engineering. However, tools, methodologies, and data sets that enable their adoption are still missing.
    	AIPerf aims to bring together AI practitioners and performance engineers and promote the dissemination of research works that use or study explainable/white-box AI techniques for quantitative analysis of modern ICT systems.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
    <p>
    	Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are widely adopted techniques to investigate several mainstream domains (e.g., computer vision, natural language processing, and even reliability analysis). However, their usage for performance modeling and evaluation is still limited, and their benefit to the performance engineering field remains unclear. AIPerf 2023 proposes a meeting venue to promote the dissemination of research works that use or study AI techniques for quantitative analysis of modern ICT systems and to engage academics and practitioners of this field. The workshop focuses on presenting experiences and results of applying AI/ML-based techniques to performance-related problems, as well as sharing performance datasets and benchmarks with the community to facilitate the development of new and more accurate learning procedures.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    	We solicit three tracks of submission:
    	<ul>
    		<li>Research or industry full papers (max 8 pages)</li>
    		<li>Research or industry short papers (max 4 pages)</li>
    		<li>Industry experience reports (max 2 pages)</li>
    	</ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    	The AIPerfworkshop welcomes submissions reporting methodological and practical research that advances and promotes the usage of Artificial Intelligence for the performance evaluation of ITC systems. The list of topics includes (but is not limited to):
    	<ul>
    		<li>AI for tuning ITC systems based on their performance</li>
    		<li>AI-generated models aimed at engineering the performance of ITC systems</li>
    		<li>Analysis and prediction of ITC system performance using AI</li>
    		<li>Performance Modeling of AI systems and frameworks</li>
    		<li>Datasets and benchmarks for training and validating AI performance models</li>
    	</ul>
    </p>
