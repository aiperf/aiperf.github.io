SCOPE AND TOPICS
------------------------------

AIPerf intends to foster the usage of AI (such as probabilistic methods, machine learning, 
and deep learning) to control, model, and predict the performance of computer systems. 
The timeliness and relevance of this topic reflect current and future trends toward exploiting 
AI-based approaches to deal with complex, large, and interconnected systems. However, 
their usage for performance modeling and evaluation is still limited, and their benefit to the 
performance engineering field remains unclear. 

AIPerf 2023 proposes a meeting venue to promote the dissemination of research works that use 
or study AI techniques for quantitative analysis of modern ICT systems and to engage academics 
and practitioners of this field. The workshop focuses on presenting experiences and results of 
applying AI/ML-based techniques to performance-related problems, as well as sharing performance 
datasets and benchmarks with the community to facilitate the development of new and more accurate 
learning procedures.

Specifically, AIPerf 2023 welcomes submissions reporting methodological and practical research 
that advances and promotes the usage of Artificial Intelligence for the performance evaluation 
of ICT systems. The list of topics includes (but is not limited to):

    • AI-based performance evaluation and tuning for ICT systems
    • AI-based generation of performance models for ICT systems engineering
    • Performance modeling of AI systems and frameworks
    • Datasets and benchmarks for training and validating AI performance models
    • Explainable and White-box AI techniques for performance engineering
    • Heuristic and metaheuristic techniques for performance engineering
    • AI models for performance anomaly detection, classification, root cause analysis and remediation
    • AI models for performance tasks automation, including auto-scaling and self-optimization
    • Human computer interfaces for AI based performance tasks

AIPerf solicits two tracks of submission:

    • Regular research papers (max 8 pages). Novel contributions that are fully 
      validated and well positioned in the state-of-the-art.
    • Empirical, experience, reproduction or case study papers (max 6 pages). 
      Work-in-progress; Vision papers; New ideas that still need to be validated; 
      Industrial case studies; Experiences (positive or negative) of using AI
      for performance engineering.

The workshop proceedings are published in ACM Digital Library as the ICPE2023 conference 
companion post-proceedings. For more information visit: https://aiperf.github.io/aiperf2023/submission/


INSTRUCTION FOR AUTHORS FROM ACM
--------------------------------

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors.  The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022.  We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
